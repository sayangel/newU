    "hacker":"I did a hackathon event once and I accidentally had a bit too much to drink. I hadn’t eaten dinner so I was white girl wasted after a couple of beers. Anyway I ended up texting a bunch of stupid shit to an ex-girlfriend, to my mom, to my boss. Luckily it was in the middle of the night since it was an all night hackathon thing, so I pounded some coffee and sobered up and realized I had to fix this. So I ended up creating an app that lets you retract sent messages as long as the recipient hasn’t read the text message yet. And I won the hackathon, which was nuts. I ended up being able to retract the texts I sent to my mom and my ex-girlfriend, but the text I sent my boss woke him up and saw that I texted him, “You’re the sweetest candything in this wonka world we live in, mm let me put sprinkles on your face meow meow cookie wasup.” So, I got fired. ",
    "comedian":"A few years back, in order to get stage time at a comedy club, I worked as one of those people with the clipboards in Times Square who try to sell you comedy tickets. Most of the people selling those tickets that are actually comedians, I don’t know if you know that. If you are on the street selling for like an hour or two, then you get to do five minutes of stand-up at the comedy club. If you sell any tickets, then you can potentially get more stage time. So I’m out there, trying to sell these tickets, but nobody is buying. I also felt bad overcharging these naive tourists so even if somebody came up to me and was like, “Hey I want to buy tickets ” I would tell them, “No, you really don’t. This is a huuuge waste of your money.” Eventually these two German guys, about college-aged, come up to me and we get along great. We’re laughing and joking around. They figure out I’m a comedian so they are demanding to buy tickets to the show I’ll be performing on later. And if somebody with a German accent is demanding something, I’ll usually say yes because it’s scary. So I sell them the tickets. Well, cut to the show, and the entire “audience” is honestly just these two poor German guys. I’m performing to just them, so I didn’t even use the microphone. I just sat on the edge of the stage with my legs dangling down and apologized to these dudes for my entire 5 minute set. I quit that shitty job later that night.",
    "athlete":"You remember how Forrest Gump did that epic run across the country? Well my little brother bet me that I couldn’t run from our house on the East Coast all the way to California without dying. And I’m extremely competitive, so I bet him that I definitely could make the run and not die. I was still in college at that point so I had to take a semester off because I figured it would take me like 3 months if I ran at a leisurely pace. I packed up a fanny pack filled with sandwiches and water and stuff. Spent like a week stretching out and getting nimble. By then, my entire town had heard about this bet so people were really into it, setting up web pages and charity drives. I got all these sponsors, it was nuts. By the time I was ready to get going, there was a huge crowd gathered at my house with signs. Everyone was cheering. I was jacked up. Heart pounding. Huge smile on my dumb face. Finally I just started running, and I theatrically flipped off my brother behind my back. But I guess I flipped him off at a weird angle or something because I felt this massive pain shoot through my whole back and I fell forward. Then a huge pain shot through both my ankles. Keep in mind, I’m like 20 feet into my cross-country run. The massive crowd that had gathered to see me off gasped and was silent. They everyone burst out laughing. So my brother won the bet because I had broken my ankle. ",
    "musician":"In high school, my jazz band went to Barcelona one year to play a few concerts and see jazz shows there. It was a week-long trip during Spring Break. I had never been to Spain so it was pretty exciting. When we got there, it was almost immediately the best. The food was great, the people were very nice, the music was fucking awesome. On our last night there, my friend and I snuck out of the hotel with our instruments because we wanted to hit up a jazz club and play some music, get the real Barcelona experience. We were walking down La Rambla, which is the central street in Barcelona. We spent a lot of time on La Rambla during the days but had never been on it at night. And holy shit does that street turn ungodly at night. During the day there are all these vendors and tourists. At night, it’s littered with prostitutes and guys selling guns and pickpockets. And the two of us, two high school kids with instrument cases bigger than our bodies. La Rambla is a really long street and there’s really no other way to get across the city, so we didn’t have any other options because we were about halfway down the street. So we speed up our pace, which was totally noticeable. Eventually a group of guys caught up to us and circled us. They were speaking in Catalan and neither I nor my friend knew what was going on, so we just kinda froze there. The guys ended up mugging us and since we didn’t have any money on us, they took our instruments, which we had both been renting from our high school. Since we were flying out the next day, we pretended that the airline lost our instruments and it totally worked so we never got in trouble. ",
    "student":"I was always an honest student, I never cheated or plagiarized or anything. Except for one time. I was in precalculus my freshman year of high school and our teacher had banned calculators because everyone was storing formulas and stuff in the programmable section of their graphing calculators. At that time, I was so dependent on a calculator that this made things very difficult for me. I hadn’t even been using my calculator to store formulas and cheat, I needed the calculator for its intended purpose because my brain was slow and stupid. So, I snuck my calculator near my foot and used it a few times during the test. Well, as my teacher was walking around the classroom during the test, he stopped at my desk and bent down. My heart was racing. I knew it, I had totally gotten myself caught and would be expelled. Shit, shit, shit. I am such an idiot. My teacher continues bending down under my desk. Then, he somehow, by the grace of God, does not see the calculator and instead picks up my textbook which is under my desk and takes it to the front of the classroom so he can flip through it and check some homework problems he assigned. The teacher was just borrowing my fucking textbook! How did he not see the calculator that was inches away from the textbook? Or maybe he did see it and he was just protecting me? Who the hell knows! As the urine was running down my leg, I promised that I would never put myself in a situation like that again.",
    "socialite":"I am a firm believer that if you walk with confidence and act like you know where you’re going, you can get in anywhere. It also helps if you’re super attractive and rich. Last summer I was in Paris with some friends and we were going to this posh club on Avenue Foch called Le Duplex. We put on our flashiest clothes because we wanted all eyes on us. So we roll up in a limo (duh), some nameless club attendant opens the door for us and we strut toward the door like god damn celebrities. There was a massive line to our right but we didn’t stop blazing toward the door like a bunch of sexy meteors. The bouncer started to ask us who we were, in French, but we didn’t even give him a chance. I immediately cut him off and say “We’re supposed to be here. Check every list. Don’t make me call my father.” That clearly scared the shit out of him because he opened the velvet rope and led us to the best spot in the whole club. Le Duplex has this crazy, massive mixed drink, jungle juice type thing you can order and it comes in a FUCKING TREASURE CHEST, which is literally the size of a treasure chest. So of course we polished off two of those suckers before the night was over. I made out with 14 people and got my passport stolen. It was the best night of my life. ",
    "bro":"I love lots of things in life. I love top shelf bourbon and cheap light beers. I love visors and North Face fleeces. I love free market capitalism and standing on the shoulders of those less fortunate. But most of all, I fuckin’ love BOATS. I remember one time, a few summers back, I was on my dad’s boat with some of my fraternity brothers from Dartmouth. I had just woken up from a blackout. Well, you call them blackouts. I call them booze naps. I wake up from my booze nap, and the boat is on land! It ain’t a damn car so you can see how this is a problem, right? I guess what had happened was that we partied all night out at sea like a bunch of degenerates and once everyone passed out, nobody was manning the captain’s wheel. During that time, Cecilia, which is the name of my dad’s boat because he’s a huge Simon & Garfunkel fan, crashed ashore and was slowly, inch by inch, pushed fully out of the water. I’m sure you could understand why this was a problem for me. So I woke everybody on the boat up, and we gathered on land like the drunk, dysfunctional army of morons that we are and we started trying to push this beast of a boat back into the water. Everybody’s hungover as hell, so guys are puking from the physical exertion. This thing isn’t fuckin’ moving, though. So I do what any college-educated, entitled, upper-class would do. I whip out my iPhone and check when the next high tide will be. Boom, mothafucka! It’s tonight! So we get back on the boat and play beer pong and flip cup until that happens. The tide ends up carrying us back into the ocean and we all lived happily ever after. Well, not all of us. We lost one of our pledges, Shit-Brick, out at sea. But that’s fraternity life, man. Can’t dwell on those things!",
    "vegan":"Okay, full disclosure: until very recently, I was an ovo-lacto-friendly vegetarian, meaning I consumed egg and dairy products in addition to excluding meat and seafood from my diet. In other words, I was a lazy herbivore. I fully transitioned to veganism last week on a dare, and well, here I am. I don’t even really do this whole diet because I’m a huge animal rights activist or a health nut or anything. I just kinda find meat to be icky yicky in my tummy yummy. I’ll watch one of those hard-hitting documentaries about the corruption and environmental abuse that runs rampant throughout American agribusiness, and it really does nothing for me either way. It’s really just the taste of meat that I don’t like. It just feels weird to eat another thing that used to have a heartbeat and fingernails, you know? Wait do animals have fingernails? I guess they’d have to have fingers and most of them don’t. Okay so no fingernails. But still. They have skin and stuff and I don’t mean like plum or apple skin, I mean like straight up SKIN. Ew. Gross. ",
    "brooklynite":"Wow, I can't believe they don't serve PBR here. I don’t want to sound out of line here, but PBR is the fucking backbone of this nation. Anyway, I woke up like this. Yeah I know my hair looks perfectly manicured and my cardigan is very purposefully mis-buttoned, but I swear I woke up this morning looking exactly like this. Well, I guess it wasn’t this morning, but more like this afternoon. My alarm usually goes off in the morning, blaring the Dirty Projectors mashed up with Beirut, which the ultimate morning jam. But I’m done waking up early and going to work. I quit that square job. 9 to 5 at an architecture agency? Do I look like Joseph Gordon-Levitt in 500 Days of Summer? I do? Oh. Well. Fuck, ignore that I said that. Anyway, I quit my job. You see, my family’s trust fund money finally kicked in over the weekend, so I don’t really have to go to work anymore. I never wanted to be a slave to capitalism but now that I have a bunch of money, I’m kind of down. ",
    "workaholic":"I accomplished a pretty massive goal last month. In the midst of studying for my third graduate degree, I did all of my work at my job for the next four years. In theory, I could just come into the office for the next four years and do absolutely nothing because it’s all done, but I’m not that kind of person. I’m going to keep getting ahead. I’m going to climb to the top and never stop. And once I hit the top? Well once I hit the top I’m gonna grow some fucking wings and take off. So what if most people are out having fun? I’m 23, it’s time to buckle down and focus on my future. I have future grandchildren to think about. I can rest and sleep when I’m dead. So what if my doctor told me I couldn’t keep surviving on three hours of sleep per night? ",
    "wizard":"I fell through fire and water. Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside. Darkness took me. And I strayed out of thought and time. Stars wheeled overhead and everyday was as long as a life-age of the earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again. I've been sent back until my task is done. Gandalf? Yes... That's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name. I am Gandalf the White. And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide. One stage of your journey is over, another begins. War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all speed.",
