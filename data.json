    "bodyLang": "Make sincere eye contact and loosen your tear ducts. Be ready to tear up at any sad anecdote.\nListen much more than you speak. If you speak, use your words to ask follow-up questions and encourage others to delve into their issues more.\nDo not slouch and remain in relatively close, non-creepy proximity with whomever you’re speaking.\nKeep your hands out of your pockets so you’re ready to cover your mouth during moments of “Oh no he/she did not! That is just awful!”\nWalk with purpose from one emotional moment to the next. Seek out emotional conversations to which you can react. Be able to sniff out the gloom in the venue.",

    "anecdote": "I accomplished a pretty massive goal last month. In the midst of studying for my third graduate degree, I did all of my work at my job for the next four years. In theory, I could just come into the office for the next four years and do absolutely nothing because it’s all done, but I’m not that kind of person. I’m going to keep getting ahead. I’m going to climb to the top and never stop. And once I hit the top? Well once I hit the top I’m gonna grow some fucking wings and take off. So what if most people are out having fun? I’m 23, it’s time to buckle down and focus on my future. I have future grandchildren to think about. I can rest and sleep when I’m dead. So what if my doctor told me I couldn’t keep surviving on three hours of sleep per night?  Why aren’t you listening? I’m baring my soul here and you’re not even paying attention. I’m gonna cry so hard.",
