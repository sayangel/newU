    "anecdote": "I accomplished a pretty massive goal last month. In the midst of studying for my third graduate degree, I did all of my work at my job for the next four years. In theory, I could just come into the office for the next four years and do absolutely nothing because it’s all done, but I’m not that kind of person. I’m going to keep getting ahead. I’m going to climb to the top and never stop. And once I hit the top? Well once I hit the top I’m gonna grow some fucking wings and take off. So what if most people are out having fun? I’m 23, it’s time to buckle down and focus on my future. I have future grandchildren to think about. I can rest and sleep when I’m dead. So what if my doctor told me I couldn’t keep surviving on three hours of sleep per night?  Why aren’t you listening? I’m baring my soul here and you’re not even paying attention. I’m gonna cry so hard.",

    "anecdote": "I am a firm believer that if you walk with confidence and act like you know where you’re going, you can get in anywhere. It also helps if you’re super attractive and rich. Last summer I was in Paris with some friends and we were going to this posh club on Avenue Foch called Le Duplex. We put on our flashiest clothes because we wanted all eyes on us. So we roll up in a limo (duh), some nameless club attendant opens the door for us and we strut toward the door like god damn celebrities. There was a massive line to our right but we didn’t stop blazing toward the door like a bunch of sexy meteors. The bouncer started to ask us who we were, in French, but we didn’t even give him a chance. I immediately cut him off and say “We’re supposed to be here. Check every list. Don’t make me call my father.” That clearly scared the shit out of him because he opened the velvet rope and led us to the best spot in the whole club. Le Duplex has this crazy, massive mixed drink, jungle juice type thing you can order and it comes in a FUCKING TREASURE CHEST, which is literally the size of a treasure chest. So of course we polished off two of those suckers before the night was over. I made out with 14 people and got my passport stolen. It was the best night of my life.  Aren’t I the shit? How awesome is that story!",
